      After inheriting the money from his uncle, he was thinking of what to do with the money.
      He thought about investing in businesses, but he could not decide on which business to invest in.
      He read about investing in bitcoins, but after seeing the fluctuations on the market, he decided that
      it was not a risk worth taking. He got a headache from thinking too much, he decided to make a run to the
      Liquor Store.
